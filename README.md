# FurqanPy
Mushaf / Qur'an using old King Fahd Uthmani script in Python

A simple GTK+3 Qur'an app built mainly for linux PCs.
Using the old Uthmani Madina - 15 lines - script (will maybe include the new script later on).
Can be run directly from the python file.

If anyone is interested to help with this project, you're most welcome.
